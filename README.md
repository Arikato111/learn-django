# <p align="center">Learn Django</p>

just try to learn Django

I study from [Django Framework | KongRuksiam](https://youtu.be/XLMLveR2BYo)

## Get started

* if using windows change `python3` in **script.py** to `python`

- run command bellow to run server

```bash
python3 script.py dev
```

- or run default Django's command.

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## Need to know 

- I have no idea why I must use Django. 
- I try to learn for answer the question that Why I should use it?
- Why not expressjs, nextjs  but Django? Why~?
- I think it be like Laravel but simple than it.
- and of course I don't want to use Laravel '~'
- However, I have more happiness with React, Nextjs or TypeScript, but I still learning it.
